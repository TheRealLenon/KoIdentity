# KoIdentity

KoIdentity is a simple  and lightweight membership system primarily used for building ASP.NET Core web application, including membership, login and user data. It allows you to add authorization and authenticating features to your application and makes it easy to customize data on how to access specific parts of your application.

A simple user system allows to create, edit or delete a user. A role system allows individual roles to be created or deleted from the platform. At the same time, a previously created role can be assigned to a user, allowing specific endpoints to be limited to the respective role name through a simply held authorization.
